My name is **Amrit Rathie**. I'm a student at **Grapevine High School** (class of 2021) in Grapevine, Texas, studying computer science and exploring the wonders and intricacies of programming languages.

I'm a aspiring **PL researcher**, and I'm planning to major in Computer Science in college.

I know **Rust**, **Haskell**, **Go**, **Java**, Python, Javascript, C++, C#, Ruby, Perl, and C (in order of experience).

I have experience with **programming language design and development**, web development (frontend and backend), embedded/IoT programming, game development, and general systems programming.

I'm also familiar with theoretical computer science, from calculus to **category theory**.
